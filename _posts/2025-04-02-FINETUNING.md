## Fine Tuning

Form filling is a common task that can be automated using Large Language Models (LLMs). This project focuses on developing a system that can automatically extract relevant information from unstructured text and populate form fields intelligently.

### Project Overview


The system may works in two ways:
1. **Text Copy-Paste**: Users can copy text from any source (emails, documents, etc.) and paste it into the form.

2. **Speech-to-Text**: Users can speak the information, which gets converted to text and then pasted into the form.

### How It Works

1. **Input Processing**:
   - Text input: Direct processing of copied text
   - Voice input: Conversion of speech to text using Speech Recognition

2. **LLM Processing**:
   - The text is sent to a fine-tuned LLM
   - The model identifies and extracts relevant information
   - Common fields like names, dates, addresses, and other structured data are recognized

3. **Form Population**:
   - Extracted information is mapped to corresponding form fields
   - The form is automatically filled with the relevant data
   - Users can review and edit the auto-filled information

### Fine-Tuning Approach

The LLM needs to be fine-tuned for:
- Field recognition in various text formats
- Understanding context-specific information
- Mapping extracted data to appropriate form fields
- Handling different types of forms and fields

### Benefits

- Saves time on manual data entry
- Reduces human error
- Improves user experience
- Works with multiple input methods
- Adaptable to different form types
